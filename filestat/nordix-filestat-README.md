## What it does

- Scans a directory recursively and reports file count, total size, average, median, min, max, and a size distribution breakdown from 4 KB to 1 MB+.

---

## Filtered vs All

#### **By default, nordix-filestat excludes file types that are irrelevant when measuring actual data content: text files, scripts, source code, configs, images, icons, fonts, desktop entries, empty files and symlinks.**

- **USE:** -a to include everything.

## Why this exists

- Nordix Yggdrasil runs on ZFS.
- Properties like recordsize have a significant impact on performance and space efficiency.
- The optimal value depends on what kind of files a dataset actually contains.
- This tool gives you the data to make that decision yourself rather than guessing.
